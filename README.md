# Self-Supervised-Representation-learning-for-medical-imaging-CV-Project-
A project exploring self-supervised learning (SimCLR) for chest X-ray analysis. We develop medical-specific augmentations, evaluate label efficiency, and investigate cross-dataset transfer (NIH ↔ CheXpert). The project also includes Grad-CAM explain-ability and embedding visualizations to understand model decisions.
